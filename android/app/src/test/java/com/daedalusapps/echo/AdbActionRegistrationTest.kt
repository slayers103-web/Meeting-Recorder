/**
 * Structural guard against the class of bug where MainActivity's debug-only ADB
 * BroadcastReceiver has a `when` branch (a "handled" action) with no matching entry in the
 * dynamic IntentFilter built in onCreate (a "registered" action), so the branch can never run.
 *
 * [AdbActions] is the single source of truth both MainActivity and this test read from. This
 * test does not just assert that object equals itself — it checks that MainActivity's `when`
 * block actually has a branch referencing every [AdbActions.HANDLED] constant, and that onCreate
 * actually builds its IntentFilter from [AdbActions.REGISTERED] rather than a hand-typed list.
 *
 * This file also guards the security fix: AndroidManifest.xml's `.AdbReceiver` declaration must stay
 * `android:exported="true"` (adb shell needs that) but must carry no `<intent-filter>` (an
 * intent-filter would let any other installed app reach it via an IMPLICIT broadcast), and the dynamic
 * receiver registered in onCreate must use `ContextCompat.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` since it is only
 * ever reached via `.AdbReceiver`'s in-package forward. This closes both the implicit-broadcast
 * path (no intent-filter) and the explicit-component residual (`.AdbReceiver` now also declares
 * `android:permission="android.permission.DUMP"`, so only a sender holding that
 * signature|privileged|development permission — i.e. adb shell — can deliver to it at all).
