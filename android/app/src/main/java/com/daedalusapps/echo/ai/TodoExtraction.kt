/**
 * Same dedup rule as [isDuplicateTodo], operating on already-normalized strings so callers
 * that maintain a running normalized list don't have to re-normalize on every check.
 * Exact normalized equality always counts as a duplicate. Containment (either direction)
 * only counts when the SHORTER of the two normalized strings is at least
 * [MIN_CONTAINMENT_LENGTH] chars, so short todos like "buy" or "call" don't suppress every
 * longer todo that happens to contain them. A third rule catches paraphrases: if the
 * stopword-filtered word sets of both strings are non-empty and exactly equal (again guarded
 * by [MIN_CONTAINMENT_LENGTH] on the shorter normalized string), they count as a duplicate.
 * Subset relationships are deliberately NOT treated as duplicates here — e.g. "call dad" is
 * not a duplicate of "call mom and dad" — since that would over-suppress distinct todos that
 * merely share some words against the full persistent todo history.
